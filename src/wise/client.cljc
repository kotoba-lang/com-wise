(ns wise.client
  "Portable core for talking to the Wise (formerly TransferWise) Platform
  API -- one auth/HTTP boundary for every wise.* namespace in this library.

  Query construction and response parsing are pure .cljc. The actual HTTP
  call is JVM-only by default (java.net.http) but always takes an
  injectable `:http-fn` -- the same `{:url :method :headers :body} ->
  {:status :body}` convention as gmail.client/cloudflare.client
  (kotoba-lang/com-gmail, kotoba-lang/com-cloudflare) -- so every namespace
  here is testable with a stub, never only against a live account.

  Auth is a bearer API token (a personal/service token, or an OAuth2 access
  token for a Wise Partner integration). Obtaining that token is out of
  scope for this library -- callers pass one, the same way cloudflare.client
  expects a pre-obtained CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN."
