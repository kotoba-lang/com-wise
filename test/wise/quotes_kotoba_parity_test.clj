;; Parity test: wise.quotes/create-quote! (the .cljc oracle) vs the compiled
;; src/wise/quotes.kotoba slice (quote-request-path / quote-request-method /
;; quote-request). The kotoba artifact is compiled for real by the amu
;; compiler and exercised through node; the cljc side is exercised through a
;; stub :http-fn that captures the request wise.client/request! actually
;; issues. Parity means: same method, same URL path under the API base, and
;; the kotoba request record agrees with both.
